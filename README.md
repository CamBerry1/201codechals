Repo for Ops 201 Code Challenges

This repo contains my first steps into using bash and pwoershell. Judging from what I've seen elsewhere, it's very basic, but also contains the conceptual foundation to propel me forward. I plan on using scripts for automation as much as I can in the future. The big 3: variables, functions, and conditionals. I'm still wrapping my head around syntax. I feel that more repetition will help with that.

My favorite one by far is the last one, Ops Challenge 13. Going back to bash after using powershell for a couple of weeks felt like coming home. I did have to remind myself how some of the syntax works but I'm very happy with the resulting script. Looking back at some of my earlier scripts, I see some inefficiency. I think that if given those challenges now, I have more of a foundation to clean them up.

Challenges 9, 10, and 12, in particular are intriguing. I can absolutely see writing scripts like these for troubleshooting, once I know how to interpret the output.

I want to use more time to get more reps into scripting. Powershell in particular. I see how powerful that tool can be and I'm excited to get more into it as time goes on. Windows is such a prevelant OS. Being able to use powershell in the workplace would be much more efficient than using the GUI for troubleshooting. For now, it's just one little building block at a time.
